## CS263 Project.

This website displays movie information based on the user's preferences. You can search for movies and add them to a public list to get information about the movies. You could also filter movies (on genre, director or year) from either the public user list or the official IMDB's Top 250 list.

You could for example get a list of all the thriller movies on IMDB's Top 250 list released between 1950 and 1960 that are directed by Alfred Hitchcock (there are 6).
